      <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha%27s_Vineyard">Martha's Vineyard </a>is an island located south of Cape Cod in Massachusetts that is known for being an affluent summer colony. It includes the smaller Chappaquiddick Island .
        It is the 58th largest island in the United States, with a land area of 100 square miles (260 km2), and the third largest on the East Coast of the United States.
        Martha's Vineyard is primarily known as a summer colony, and it is only accessible by boat and air.A study by the Martha's Vineyard Commission found that the cost of living on the island is 60% higher than the national average, and housing prices are 96% higher.
        Though over the years Martha’s Vineyard has earned a reputation as a retreat for presidents and the rich and famous, at heart what draws visitors to return again and again is the lure of peace, privacy, and the atmosphere of a place apart where pleasures of a simpler time can be recaptured.  Only seven short miles from the mainland but with a marked absence of highways, malls and city stress, Martha’s Vineyard continues to draw thousands to its shores to enjoy the beaches that ring its perimeter, historic sites, arts and cultural events, great dining and shopping and the comforts of its inns, resorts and rental homes.
